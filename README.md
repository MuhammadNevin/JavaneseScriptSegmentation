## Data Science CRISP-DM Assignment Project
#### Group Member : Muhammad Nevin, Alfarabi Muzli
### Description
Transliteration is necessary for Javanese script documents that include a lot of information.
The outcomes of the transliteration solely affect the characters' readability.
In order for a larger audience to understand the material, Javanese script must be translated and segmentated.

### Problem Statement
In order for a larger audience to understand the material, it must also be translated into Javanese script. It needs word segmentation for further analysis.
